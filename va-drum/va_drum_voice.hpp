// The analog bass drum voice: a struck resonator, not an oscillator.
//
// A 1 ms trigger pulse kicks a bridged-T bandpass and its ringing is the entire
// sound. Everything else here shapes the strike or the ring-down. Blocks are cut
// where high-impedance stages are driven by low-impedance ones, so each solves
// independently -- there is no global iterative solve anywhere in this circuit,
// and none of the nonlinearities need one either.
//
// Lineage: Werner, Abel & Smith, DAFx-14 (a physically-informed,
// circuit-bendable digital model of a classic analog bass-drum circuit), and
// the published Service Notes schematic its Fig. 1 is adapted from. Derived
// from those equations and that schematic only.
