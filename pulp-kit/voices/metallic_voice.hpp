// The metallic 808 voices: closed hat, open hat, and cymbal.
//
// All three are the SAME circuit -- a cluster of free-running square-wave
// oscillators at fixed, inharmonic frequencies, summed, high-passed, and then
// gated by an amplitude envelope. The closed and open hats are identical but
// for the length of that envelope (the closed hat is a tick, the open hat
// rings). The cymbal shares the design and adds two lower partials plus a
// lower high-pass corner to darken its longer ring. All three are one class
// parameterised by a small config rather than three near-duplicate voices.
//
// The oscillators free-run; a trigger does NOT reset their phase. Only the
// envelope restarts. This matches the hardware -- the six Schmitt-trigger
// oscillators never stop -- and it means the metallic cluster is already in
// steady state when the envelope opens, so there is no per-hit filter
// transient, just a clean gated decay.
//
// The closed hat "chokes" the open hat: on a real machine both share the
// output VCA, so striking closed cuts an open hat still ringing. That is a
// relationship between two voices, not a property of one, so it is modelled as
// choke() -- a fast forced release the owning group calls on the open hat when
// the closed hat fires. See test_kit_metallic.cpp for the measured choke.
//
// Circuit lineage: the classic analog cymbal/hi-hat section -- six square oscillators
// into a high-pass and an envelope VCA. Frequencies, high-pass corner, decay
// times and the small noise admixture here are calibrated to the *measured*
// output of the reference instrument (cluster peaks, spectral centroid and
// T60 per voice); the sound is still generated sample by sample by the
// oscillator cluster and filter below, never replayed from a sample.
