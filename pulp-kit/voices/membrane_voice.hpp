// The tom / conga voice: the bass-drum's struck bridged-T circuit, tuned up.
//
// A tom is not a new circuit. It is the same Zobel bridged-T resonator that
// makes the bass drum -- struck by a pulse, its ringing wrapped in the same
// regenerative feedback buffer that lifts the bare network's Q into a long
// ring -- with its capacitive arms scaled down so the centre frequency lands
// in the low-mid ("membrane") band instead of the sub-bass. Everything that
// makes the bass-drum voice faithful (states are capacitor voltages, so a
// per-sample parameter change preserves stored energy; a trigger superposes
// onto whatever ring is in flight rather than restarting it) is inherited by
// reusing BassDrumVoice directly.
//
// What differs from the bass drum, and why:
//   * The tuning is set by substituting the bridged-T capacitors rather than by
//     the Tune pot, because the pot only spans +/-2 octaves around the nominal
//     49 Hz and a tom sits ~2.8 octaves above it. Scaling C41 == C42 moves the
//     centre frequency and leaves Q exactly invariant (see bridged_t_q), so the
//     drum keeps its character at the new pitch -- the same property the Tune
//     pot relies on, used over a wider range.
//   * The pitch sigh (Q43 leakage) is disabled. The bass drum's sigh is a
//     sub-bass-specific behaviour driven by the ring amplitude at the op-amp
//     rails; a struck tom reads as a pure tone (measured spectral flatness of
//     the reference tom pads is ~0.001, i.e. a clean body), so the leakage path
//     is cut and the body rings at a fixed pitch.
//   * The retrigger pulse and attack-frequency shunt are left off: both exist
//     to repair the sub-bass note's amplitude/pitch step and have no analogue
//     in the tom's short, clean strike.
//
// Lineage: the bridged-T resonator and BassDrumVoice this reuses derive from
// Werner, Abel & Smith, DAFx-14 (a physically-informed, circuit-bendable
// digital model of a classic analog bass-drum circuit), and the published
// Service Notes schematic. The tom/conga family shares that bridged-T generator; the
// tuning band and per-preset decay below are calibrated to the measured output
// of the reference instrument (numbers only -- no reference audio is stored or
// replayed; every sample here is produced by the circuit model).

// presets place the voice on those measured pads.
//
// Measured targets (velocity-120 render, 48 kHz):

//   A (lo/lo-mid)   347           1.043       418          0.017

// The single struck-bridged-T body reproduces the dominant ~347 Hz ring and its

// higher (363 Hz, +4.6% -- inside the 7% body tolerance) to carry its measured
// brightness/pitch tilt (its ring sits above 347 Hz in the reference).
//
// The decay knobs below are the inverse of the voice's own T60(k) response at
// the 650 k decay pot, bisection-fit so each pad's rendered T60 lands within
// ~0.1% of its measured target; the levels are the reference peaks normalized
// to the loudest pad. Rendered at the reference definitions (48 kHz, one hit,
